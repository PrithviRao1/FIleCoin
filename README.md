# Dapp for automating the freelancing industry on Web3 
In the transition of Web2 to Web3 , we would like to reel in the Freelancing industry. The Dapp handles all the the internal work of a freelancing project . Functionality is Described in detail below:
// Define all the functions
A Lancer is a registered user who can upload Freelancing Projects to the Dapp
AddLancer function is used to register a Lancer , and CreateProject is called by a lancer to create a new project , in which he gives the name , description and pays the fees for the project as well. The Cryptocurrency payment is kept in the smart contract temporarily.
After a new project is created and posted , Freelancers can check the list of all available projects , and check their description as well. If he is interested , he can take the porject using the take project function. After he is done working on it , he can submit the project.
The Lancer who uploaded the project can then approve or reject the submission by the freelancer.
Upon Approval , the Cryptocurrency stored on the contract is transferred to the Freelancer who submitted the project.
Further scope for improvement:
1. A Blockchain based communication protocol to allow the Lancer and the Coder to discuss finer details of the project
2. Handling Advertising time and giving refund to the Lancer if no one accepts the project within given period of time
3. Settign deadlines for project completion
